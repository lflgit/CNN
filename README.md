# Convolution Neural Network for Satellite Image Classification 
A Computer Science graduate course project done in 2017 Fall. The project was completed with R. 

### Guide
Please check the html file first before determining whether the rmd file is needed. The html file can be opened directly in a browers and display the code together with their outputs right below each chunk. The rmd file contains all the detailed code. 

To use the code, please prepare your own image and training and testing sample sets. Please note that this work is for satellite image semantic segmentation. All the data used are geo-referenced (they all have a spatial component). GIS software may be needed to prepare the training and testing sets. 

### Content
1) Data preparation: load multispectral (8 bands) image and training and testing samples (spatial points)
2) Patch sample preparation (3x3 and 5x5)
3) CNN model contruction
4) CNN model implementation
5) Accuracy Accessment

### Keywords
Deep Learning, Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Semantic Segmentation, Image Processing
